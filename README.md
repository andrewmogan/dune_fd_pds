# git lfs
git lfs (large file storage) allows for faster cloning and pulling when storing large files, such as the .csv files used in the analysis here. The download page for git lfs is [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and the instructions for installation (on Linux) are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage). Then, once git lfs is initialized, you can pull using 
```
git lfs pull
```
